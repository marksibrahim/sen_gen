June and Charlie met on a summer day.  It was so hot the grass was laying down yellow in exhaustion and the air was so heavy it was hard to breath.  June and Charlie knew it was a day they would remember.  They would tell their children that the day they met the air was sucked out of their lungs and they knew.  They just knew.

They got married on a wide green lawn and I was sitting in the first row.  The air was dry that day and it was cold.  My hair was floating out from my head as though a magnet were pulling the ends away me.  I smoothed it down as they kissed and the audience applauded.  My hands were dry and I tried.  I tried, but it was hopeless.  My hair stuck out and I wanted to cry that it wouldn't lay down for me.
